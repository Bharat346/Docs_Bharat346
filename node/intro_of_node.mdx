## Introduction to Node.js

Node.js is a **runtime environment** that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of the browser. Built on **Chrome's V8 engine**, it provides a fast and scalable solution for server-side applications. Node.js is widely used for building **web servers, APIs, real-time applications, and microservices**.

### Why Use Node.js?
- **Asynchronous & Non-blocking:** Uses an event-driven architecture, making it efficient for handling multiple requests.
- **Single Programming Language:** JavaScript is used for both client-side and server-side development.
- **Fast Execution:** The V8 engine compiles JavaScript to machine code, ensuring high performance.
- **Rich Package Ecosystem:** The **npm** (Node Package Manager) offers thousands of open-source libraries.

### Getting Started
To install Node.js, download it from the [official website](https://nodejs.org) and verify the installation using:

```sh
node -v
npm -v
```

Once installed, you can run JavaScript files using:

```sh
node app.js
```

This makes Node.js a powerful tool for modern web development, supporting frameworks like **Express.js, NestJS, and Next.js** for server-side applications.
